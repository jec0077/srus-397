# Smart Room Utilization System (SRUS)

Traditional room management systems often depend on users manually inputting data or using ineffective motion sensors, which results in inefficient energy consumption, suboptimal space allocation, waste of building resources, and overall poor building management. This issue is pronounced in dynamic environments like corporate offices, conference centers, and educational institutions, where room usage patterns vary significantly and unpredictably. These inefficiencies hinder user experience in dynamic spaces and pronounce the need for a more responsive and immediate solution that can adapt to real-time conditions and optimize facility performance. The goal of this project is to do two things: (1) optimize space utilization and maximize the efficiency of room usage by accurately monitoring occupancy patterns and adjusting allocations dynamically, and (2) provide real-time insights: track the conditions of the room and deliver actionable analytics and reports to facility managers for informed decision-making and strategic planning.
